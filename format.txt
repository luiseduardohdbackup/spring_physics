Spring Embedding Animation Script Specification
-----------------------------------------------

This file describes a format for describing an spring embedding
animation using simple script commands.

Every command is one a single line. You can introduce/delete nodes, and add or remove 
links between nodes.

1.) Nodes

A node is introduced by

    add_node <name> <image-url>

the name needs to be unique. The image is either a local file (file://) or a
web address (http://). The python code will take care of downloading and converting
the image.

A node is deleted by 

    rm_node <name> 

.
Deleting a node removes all the links this node had to other nodes, and also deletes
the textures. Freeing up resources is a good thing, otherwise the animation will
get slow after a while (and the graphic hardware's texture buffer might run out,
too).

2.) Links

Adding a link between nodes is done by

    add_link <name1> <name2>

.
You can also add parameters which influence the length and
"bounciness" of the connection.

    add_link <name1> <name2> <spring-constant> <length> <dampening>

The defaults for these values are:
    spring-constant=1.3
    len=0.3
    damp=0.3
.

For removing the link again, use
    rm_link <name1> <name2>

3.) Groups

Groups are like nodes, only they have no texture. They're good for
representing nodes that belong together (attach all nodes of a 
group to a group node)

    add_group <name>
    rm_group <name>

4.) Parameters

Other attributes of the system can be controlled by the command
    set name value
.
Parameters you can set are:

friction: "Air resistance". Controls how fast moving nodes will loose speed (default: 1.7)
